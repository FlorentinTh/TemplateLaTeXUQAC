## [2.0] - 2021-06-15

### Bug Fixes

⚠️**Breaking Changes**:

- Entirely rewrite both ```apa-uqac-fr.bst``` and ```apa-uqac-en.bst``` bibliographic style as they now completely adopt the APA 6th Provost template without using any custom document type. _Some previous changes (such as ```@patent```) may not work anymore!_

### Chore

- Remove useless PDF examples.

## [1.3.3] - 2021-05-28

### Bug Fixes

- Add missing rule for patent citations that respects APA-Provost citation template used by UQ in both french and english files.

__NOTE : your bib entry should look as follows :__

```tex
@patent{Taniguti1989,
   title = {Pyroelectric infrared sensor},
   assignee = {United States Patent and Trademark Office},
   number = {US-4800278-A},
   author = {Taniguti, Yoshiharu and Edano, Shigeki and Tanaka, Kazuhiko and Taniguti, Shiniti and Kuramoto, Megumi},
   month = jan,
   year = {1989}
 }
```

__If your bib file is exported from *Mendeley*, you should consider updating it manually since this tool currently can't handle patent entries at export. *Zotero* users are safe and *Endnote* users... do they really exist ?__
